# Omnigrid

Grids are powerfull tools to style a webpage. Blueprint 960 1kb 1140 etc. all have their own class markup (e.g span-2 for blueprint, grid_3 for 960, .onecol for 1140 etc) that tend to pollute HTML.

But while developping it is sometimes handy to throw a class in your HTML to have a quick view instead of putting it all in your css... Omniauth hopes to bring the best of both world. Oh and sorry it's only a Rails 3.1 engine (for now?).
